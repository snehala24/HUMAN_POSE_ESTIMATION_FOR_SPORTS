# HUMAN_POSE_ESTIMATION_FOR_SPORTS

This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe to create a real-time human pose detection system. The pose estimation class, powered by Mediapipe, identifies key landmarks in live webcam feed or from the video. It offers modular methods for pose detection, landmark extraction, distance calculation, and angle determination. The main function captures frames from the camera, processes them with pose estimation, and displays annotated images with FPS. Integrating computer vision and machine learning facilitates applications like fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and biomechanical analysis.
